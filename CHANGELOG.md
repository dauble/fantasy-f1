# Changelog

All notable changes to Fantasy F1 are documented here.

---

## Version 0.10.0 - 2026-05-15 - Session Validation for AI Predictions

### Features

- Added session validation to ensure only races with actual results data are included in AI predictions
- The AI prediction service now verifies each race session has position data before including it in the analysis
- When requesting recent races (e.g., "last 5 races"), the system now returns 5 actual completed races with data, rather than 5 scheduled races that may have been canceled
- Improved handling of canceled or postponed races by automatically skipping sessions without telemetry data

### Technical Improvements

- Enhanced `getRecentRaceSessions()` to validate position data availability before adding sessions to the recent races list
- Increased candidate meeting pool size to ensure sufficient races are found even when some are canceled
- Reduced log noise by removing duplicate warnings for sessions without data
- Optimized candidate pool calculation to maintain minimum size for small limit values

## Version 0.9.1 - 2026-05-09 - SEO, Social Sharing & Security Updates

### SEO & Social Sharing

- Added official F1 logo (fetched from Wikimedia Commons) as the site favicon — served as an SVG for modern browsers with a 192×192 PNG fallback and a 180×180 apple-touch-icon for iOS home screens
- Generated a 1200×630 OG image (F1 logo on dark `#15151E` background) for social share cards
- Added full Open Graph meta tags (`og:type`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, `og:image`, `og:locale`) for rich previews on Facebook, LinkedIn, Slack, and other platforms
- Added Twitter/X Card tags (`name="twitter:card"` with `content="summary_large_image"`) for expanded tweet previews
- Added Schema.org JSON-LD `WebApplication` markup with `SportsOrganization` context, feature list, and free-offer pricing — improves search engine understanding and Google rich results eligibility
- Added `<meta name="description">`, `keywords`, `author`, `robots`, and `<link rel="canonical">` tags
- Parameterized all canonical/OG/JSON-LD URLs via `VITE_PUBLIC_URL` environment variable using `vite-plugin-html` — prevents incorrect metadata when deployed to different environments or custom domains

### Housekeeping

- Removed Vite scaffold placeholder files (`public/vite.svg`, `src/assets/react.svg`) — neither was referenced anywhere in the app
- Removed empty directories (`src/components/prediction/`, `src/assets/img/`)
- Removed leftover `.vscode/settings.json` containing stale scaffold tool-approval entries (file was already gitignored)
- Bumped `package.json` version to `0.9.1` to match changelog releases

---

## Version 0.8.0 - 2026-03-15 - Smart Sync, Transfer Penalties, Team Assessment & Documentation Refresh

> Commit `HEAD` — working branch `feat/ai-enhancements`

### AI — Team Assessment & Transfer Advice

- Claude now evaluates **every pick in the user's current team** and produces a per-pick verdict (`keep` / `transfer`) with one-sentence reasoning for each, factoring in circuit fit, recent form, and whether a swap justifies the -30 pt penalty
- New `team_verdict` field (`"keep"` / `"partial"` / `"transfer"`) gives an overall headline recommendation
- New `current_team_assessment` array in the AI response carries `identifier`, `type`, `verdict`, `reason`, and `suggested_alternative` for each current pick
- Both fields forwarded through `parsePredictionJSON` and surfaced in the result object
- Driver names in the current-team prompt note now include abbreviations in parentheses for exact Claude matching

### AI — Practice Session Data Integration

- New `getPracticeDataForUpcomingRace()` in `openf1DataService.js` fetches completed FP1/FP2/FP3 classifications for the active race weekend
- Looks for any meeting within a ±6-day window; 2-hour cache TTL per meeting so each session completion is picked up automatically
- Practice top-10 tables injected into the Claude prompt so circuit-specific pace informs rankings and team assessment
- Loading progress messages: "Found N completed practice sessions — included in analysis" / "No practice data yet this weekend"
- `practice_data` passed alongside the prediction payload; `buildUserMessage` formats it into the driver ranking context

### Transfer Penalty Awareness

- **Transfer penalties now factored into team optimisation** — `computeOptimalTeam` deducts 30 pts per driver or constructor change when a current team is saved; the algorithm only recommends a swap when the expected gain exceeds the cost
- Added local `TRANSFER_PENALTY_PTS = 30` constant in `aiPredictionService.js` to keep optimisation logic self-contained (no import from `src/config/api.js`)
- `parsePredictionJSON` and `buildFallbackResult` both pass `currentTeam` to the optimizer
- Result object now exposes a `transfers` count and `budget_analysis` reports the penalty (e.g. _"— 2 transfers from current team (-60 pts penalty)"_)
- Fixed driver name resolution in `buildUserMessage`: current team is stored as `selectedDrivers` / `selectedConstructors` objects, so the prompt now derives names directly from those objects (rather than assuming driver numbers) to avoid `undefined` entries
- Claude prompt updated: transfer rule included in `SCORING_RULES` and `SYSTEM_PROMPT` so analysis commentary can flag whether keeping current picks is worth it vs. paying the penalty

### UI — Apply & Save Team (`Predictions.jsx`)

- New **Apply & Save Team** button appears at the top of the results view once a prediction completes
- One click: backs up the current team to Team History (GUID key via `crypto.randomUUID()`) then replaces the active team with the AI recommendation
- Backup label includes the race name (e.g. _"Pre-AI snapshot – Australian GP"_) so old lineups are easy to identify in Team History and can be restored at any time
- After applying, the button is replaced with a green confirmation banner linking directly to Team History
- `teamStorage.saveBackupToHistory(label)` helper added to `teamStorage.js` — saves the current team as a history entry with a unique UUID and `source: 'ai_backup'` tag, trimming history to the last 20 entries

### UI — Team Assessment Card (`Predictions.jsx`)

- New `TeamAssessmentCard` component renders below the transfer warning banner when a current team is saved
- Overall verdict banner styled green / amber / red with plain-English description
- Per-pick rows: ✅ Keep or 🔄 with suggested replacement abbreviation/name, plus Claude's reasoning sentence for each

### UI — Transfer Warning Banner (`Predictions.jsx`)

- New `TransferWarning` component renders above the AI Analysis card after predictions load
- Shows an **amber warning** listing each new driver and constructor with the total point penalty when transfers are required
- Shows a **green confirmation** badge when the recommendation matches the current team exactly (no penalty)
- Includes a tip reminding users that picks were already chosen for their net value after penalties, and that the Wildcard chip removes transfer costs

### Rules Page (`Rules.jsx`)

- Added **🔄 Transfers & Penalties** card between "Chips & Power-ups" and "Strategy Tips"
- Lists the -30 pt per change rule, the break-even threshold (new pick must score 30+ more pts), and the Wildcard escape hatch
- Callout box notes that AI predictions already account for transfer costs

### Sync Improvements

- Replaced blind push-every-60s with `smartSync` — fetches the cloud's `updated_at` timestamp before deciding whether to push or pull
- If cloud is newer than local (another device made changes): **pull from cloud**
- If local is current or newer: **push to cloud**
- `pullFromCloud` now also captures the cloud's `updated_at` into `fantasy_f1_sync_meta` so the next cycle has an accurate baseline
- `syncToCloud` records `lastSyncedAt` in `fantasy_f1_sync_meta` after every successful push
- Tab-refocus handler now calls `smartSync` instead of unconditional `pullFromCloud`
- "Sync ⇅" button (`syncBidirectional`) delegates to `smartSync` for the same reason
- Login still performs a full `pullFromCloud` — cloud is always trusted on a fresh session

### Documentation

- Updated all six documentation files to reflect current application state:
  - `README.md`: new tech stack entries, cloud sync section, dark mode section, corrected caching table, updated getting-started steps
  - `documentation/ARCHITECTURE.md`: added project-tree entries for `newsService.js`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `AuthContext.jsx`, `AuthButton.jsx`, `NEWS_INTEGRATION.md`; added Section 5 (Cloud Sync & Auth System); updated AI Predictions section (4-layer cache, news step, current race detection, sync after generation); corrected Layout section (AuthButton, dark mode toggle)
  - `documentation/AI_PREDICTIONS_SETUP.md`: added Supabase env vars, corrected loading time to 15–25s, added news-fetch step to data flow, added cross-device sync callout
  - `documentation/NEWS_INTEGRATION.md`: replaced Motorsport.com source with Autosport + The Race; updated config table and architecture diagram
  - `documentation/PROXY_SETUP.md`: expanded architecture to show all three endpoints (`/api/predict`, `/api/config`, `/api/news`); added Supabase env vars
  - `documentation/README.md`: added `NEWS_INTEGRATION.md` to the index; updated Application Overview and Tech Stack table

---

## Version 0.4 - 2026-03-10 - Rate Limiting & Caching Overhaul

> Commit `4a04ee5` — Fix AI prediction service, caching and rate limiting

- 4-layer caching system introduced in `openf1DataService.js`:
  - Layer 1: Raw API responses (24h TTL)
  - Layer 2: Per-session stats (7 days TTL)
  - Layer 3: Inter-meeting delay to avoid OpenF1 rate limits
  - Layer 4: Full prediction payload (4h TTL)
- Price unit mismatch fixed — prices stored as raw dollars (e.g. `28700000`) were being compared against `BUDGET=100` (millions); fixed by dividing by `1_000_000` at read in `openf1DataService.js` and `aiPredictionService.js`
- Dynamic next-race detection introduced — replaced hardcoded Chinese GP fallback with live OpenF1 meeting/session lookup
